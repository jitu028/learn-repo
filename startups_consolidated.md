Last month, I launched the app on Show HN. As a result, it got 82 points and 78 comments. Ranked in the toppest 10 of popular posts in a day also. Actually, we have pros and cons about it and people tend to criticize it more. Anyway, it felt so amazing that a lot of the people across the world visited my website and said hi to me. What an exciting moment! Today, I‚Äôd like to share how to develop and launch a landing page.

Let‚Äôs take a look at a classic example of a situation that I have observed numerous times. An enthusiastic maker has an idea for a great product and starts building right away without checking for competitors, creating a landing page first or getting some feedback from potential users. The maker sits down in front of his computer and starts building his product blindly.

![](https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/SFW9h62lTqHjTNTJorlg)
2,281 days ago Product Hunt launched as a tiny newsletter. The early days were especially chaotic. I didn‚Äôt get much sleep, skipped the gym, and buried my head into work. While unsustainable (I'm not advocating overworking yourself!), it was sooo fun and energizing to build something brand new. It was also scary. New products ‚Äì especially those driven by community ‚Äì are incredibly fragile.

7 days ago we launched a beta of YourStack (with a¬†grammatically incorrect, non-editable tweet¬†‚Äì lol). Instantly those same nostalgic feelings from the early days of Product Hunt re-emerged. The response has been very encouraging. Alex was kind enough to¬†write about it on BuzzFeed. Lucas followed with a¬†story on TechCrunch. And a bunch of folks shared support on Twitter and¬†Product Hunt.

But the product is very early and our roadmap is deep. So far we've onboarded only ~4% of those that have signed up as we build tooling to scale (thanks for all your patience!). I wake up each morning nervous but excited to read your feedback and wild ideas as the team and I continue building.

If you get a chance, create your account and start stacking. We're whitelisting new friendly folks each day.

Feedback? I'd love to hear it at¬†ryan@yourstack.com.

Cheers,
Ryan Hoover (@rrhoover)

In¬†Frank Herbert‚Äôs¬†1965 science fiction novel¬†Dune, we follow the story of the fall and rise of the aristocratic Atreides family circa 22,000 CE. The principal character, the marquee of the family, Paul Atreides, goes on a unique hero‚Äôs journey of guerilla warfare and political maneuvering, with both cosmological and philosophical repercussions. Without giving too much away, a central plot in the novel is Paul discovering his own¬†telos, ‚Äúthe full potential or inherent purpose‚Äù of himself, within his mind and his broader destiny. This mystery surrounding Paul‚Äôs purpose creates an underground current through most of the novel. And when the current bursts to the surface, the reader is only left to pondering a hypothetical divine mystery. Is the reader witnessing a transfiguration (see¬†Mark 9:1‚Äì10) or a revelation (See¬†Revelation 21:1), as this archetypical desert warlord develops into an enlightened desert mystic? Is Paul a mix tape of Moses meets T. E. Lawrence? Or is he experiencing the slow mental descent of an asylum-bound messiah?

I'll start off by dating myself... it was the year 2000. I was in college and the brand new Mini Disk MP3 player had just come out. Superior audio to CD's and the ability to hold hundreds of songs on 1 little disk. Being a broke college kid, it took me about 6 months to make the purchase. Just when I got used to looking cool with my MD player, a wild flash of cool came across the analog airways via a commercial from a company that was only recently regaining its cool with a crappy multicolor desktop PC called the iMac.  Of course, I'm talking about Apple. The product was the iPod. I was defeated and nearly threw away my MD player on the spot.

Roughly three and a half years ago, we started working on Tara AI, however the genesis of the story begins much earlier. It all began when I had the good fortune of meeting Syed Ahmed in freshman year of college, our company‚Äôs current co-founder and CTO. Everyday, I continue to meet with founders and hopeful entrepreneurs that are starting companies with enormous potential, and I find that the first hurdle they have to cross, is finding a partner-in-crime. I truly believe that going about building a company is an arduous journey, and its nearly impossible to build a lasting high-growth company without a co-founder (kudos to those who have achieved this as single founders). I‚Äôve also come to realize, that if you can convince another human being to invest all of their time and energy in building this ‚Äúthing‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt currently exist, then other obstacles start to become easier (even if it‚Äôs by a factor of 0.0001%).

A bit of background on our startup, Dataline. Until June 2020, our product was giving you access to your ad-blocked customer data on your analytics and marketing tools. What happened? We closed our seed round in mid-May 2020. Two weeks later, we were starting to have concerns about our product and vision. We understood that we were a vitamin rather than a painkiller. We spent the month of June exploring some new potential visions. How could we announce this to our new investors who had put money on our previous vision? What would they think of us? Would our team lose motivation, and would we lose any key employees? Of course, all these questions were in our head, but we knew it was best for everyone for us to pivot, investors included. This article is about how we handled the pivot with all the stakeholders - investors and team.¬†

Mental health has been a rising issue lately since the pandemic and it caught my attention right away since I was going crazy being stuck in my tiny studio in New York City that has no view. Also, I was consistently looking for ways to help users on Goodnight Journal who expressed depression and anxiety through public journals. Some of the ¬†public journals really got me concerned and think more about features that I can implement to help them feel better. It kind of came naturally that I want to do something about it. I ended up playing around with a bunch of mental health and meditation apps out there and came up with the app called Happy.

As technology penetrates every facet of life, and continues to grow exponentially, the solution potential becomes enormous. At the same time, we're in a world where billions live in poverty, and millions are on the brink of famine. In order to support an ever-growing populace, we need to leave no stone un-turned in the search for solutions. AI provides many potential solutions to humanity's greatest challenges."AI" is a vague, even confusing term. If you hear the phrase "artificial intelligence," you might wonder why there aren't sentient robots walking around, or why everyone isn't in self-driving cars already. The reality is that "AI" is just a marketing term for a set of computational statistical tools, or more simply, algorithms.However, as versatile as mathematics is, so is AI. AI is limited by (primarily) a couple things: data and computational power. Both the data and the compute power we have available are growing exponentially, so AI is becoming more and more powerful.With this increase in data and computational ability, AI is now being used in a wide variety of applications.For example, bitgrit (disclaimer: I'm CEO), collects meaningful AI problem statements to crowd-source solutions to data scientists. Some problem statements include saving animals‚Äô lives, increasing agricultural yield, and speeding up healthcare claims processing.Michael Suttles, CEO at Save All The Pets, explains how data and AI can be used to save shelter animals:

Many startups are founded based on unique technologies, or on problems that are interesting to solve, but don‚Äôt necessarily answer a real market need.

When friends Jessica Rolph and Rod Morris partnered to launch Lovevery in 2015, the two founders already had massive success stories under their belts.¬†

Jessica previously had a successful exit from organic baby food company Happy Family, which she founded. Rod helped take SaaS utility platform Opower public as part of the company‚Äôs leadership team.

Despite their wealth of past experience, Jessica and Rod had plenty to learn when fundraising for Lovevery, a subscription business that puts sustainable, science-backed play kits into the hands of parents. As parents themselves, Jessica and Rod knew their idea had legs when they began working on it ‚Äî¬†but they still felt ‚Äúvery vulnerable‚Äù during the fundraising process, according to Jessica.

‚ÄúWith the success we had in the raises, on the outside they [seemingly] came easily,‚Äù Jessica says. ‚ÄúBut on the inside, getting to that place where you have momentum is hard.‚Äù

As they grew Lovevery, they found fundraising successfully was all about the timing. On an episode of How I Raised It, Jessica and Rod shared the lessons that came from raising $32 million for Lovevery over three funding rounds.

It‚Äôs a decision that can make or break a startup: Do you invest in in-house resources to create your product or do you outsource software development to a third-party developer? On the one hand, as a startup, shouldn‚Äôt product development be a core competency?

A biological marvel, the human itself known as homo sapiens. In the Latin language, it stands for a wise man. A wise man that survived about 200,000 years of evolution and extinction. There are many perspectives towards its survival and today I would like to share my perspective, slightly vague but different. There is a concept of what drives you that has become popular within the last decade. Certain presumptions about the driving force are based upon raw emotional aspects such as passion and rage. I find to myself that these aspects are reactions to our stubbornness to keep on going on but the negative aspect is that these reactions are short-lived and eventually man settles with peace. I would like to share a certain experience in a short period of my life that has produced results beyond my expectations. It is a small story of how I created my IoT Device converted into a product and made a company out of it.

When friends Jessica Rolph and Rod Morris partnered to launch Lovevery in 2015, the two founders already had massive success stories under their belts.¬†

Jessica previously had a successful exit from organic baby food company Happy Family, which she founded. Rod helped take SaaS utility platform Opower public as part of the company‚Äôs leadership team.

Despite their wealth of past experience, Jessica and Rod had plenty to learn when fundraising for Lovevery, a subscription business that puts sustainable, science-backed play kits into the hands of parents. As parents themselves, Jessica and Rod knew their idea had legs when they began working on it ‚Äî¬†but they still felt ‚Äúvery vulnerable‚Äù during the fundraising process, according to Jessica.

‚ÄúWith the success we had in the raises, on the outside they [seemingly] came easily,‚Äù Jessica says. ‚ÄúBut on the inside, getting to that place where you have momentum is hard.‚Äù

As they grew Lovevery, they found fundraising successfully was all about the timing. On an episode of How I Raised It, Jessica and Rod shared the lessons that came from raising $32 million for Lovevery over three funding rounds.

Product, price, and market matter, but without the right team in place, even companies with incredible potential can stall out.

Ever been to meetings you didn't want to be a part of? Meetings you could do better without but, you had to go through thoroughly because you didn't know when your name can be announced and you knew you'd have to respond then. Yeah, we have all been there.

That's where "MSorryWhat!?" - my weekend project comes into play.

It is a simple javascript based application living here. It leverages the Webhooks and Notifications services of IFTTT (If this then that) app, to notify you when your name is announced, on the backend it leverages chrome's speech recognition engine.

I spent 10 minutes to create a demo for the tool which can be viewed here:

AI is on the rise. In some ways it was always inevitable. But ask any researcher who suffered through the 1990s in AI research and they might not agree. AI and neural networks in particular were considered a backwater for researchers for decades. If you wanted a dead end career go into neural nets. In the 1990s, one of the leading thinkers behind neural networks, Geoffrey Hinton, could barely get funding. Nobody came to his classes. He worked on his ideas in isolation.

Roughly three and a half years ago, we started working on Tara AI, however the genesis of the story begins much earlier. It all began when I had the good fortune of meeting Syed Ahmed in freshman year of college, our company‚Äôs current co-founder and CTO. Everyday, I continue to meet with founders and hopeful entrepreneurs that are starting companies with enormous potential, and I find that the first hurdle they have to cross, is finding a partner-in-crime. I truly believe that going about building a company is an arduous journey, and its nearly impossible to build a lasting high-growth company without a co-founder (kudos to those who have achieved this as single founders). I‚Äôve also come to realize, that if you can convince another human being to invest all of their time and energy in building this ‚Äúthing‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt currently exist, then other obstacles start to become easier (even if it‚Äôs by a factor of 0.0001%).

Long lines and long wait times frustrate guests and discourage them from returning to your restaurant.

Take McDonald‚Äôs as an example: In 2015, they started adopting self-service ordering kiosks that let customers select items, customize orders, and pay. Another good example is Stabucks.

By far, the top reason startups fail is¬†the lack of market need¬†(42% of the cases). Many startups are founded based on unique technologies, or on problems that are interesting to solve, but don‚Äôt necessarily answer a real market need. Understanding what market you are serving, and the problem you are addressing is key. The basis for that is early, continuous feedback from the right people who fit the early adopter profile.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/z6a63yqk.png)
When friends Jessica Rolph and Rod Morris partnered to launch Lovevery in 2015, the two founders already had massive success stories under their belts.¬†

Jessica previously had a successful exit from organic baby food company Happy Family, which she founded. Rod helped take SaaS utility platform Opower public as part of the company‚Äôs leadership team.

Despite their wealth of past experience, Jessica and Rod had plenty to learn when fundraising for Lovevery, a subscription business that puts sustainable, science-backed play kits into the hands of parents. As parents themselves, Jessica and Rod knew their idea had legs when they began working on it ‚Äî¬†but they still felt ‚Äúvery vulnerable‚Äù during the fundraising process, according to Jessica.

‚ÄúWith the success we had in the raises, on the outside they [seemingly] came easily,‚Äù Jessica says. ‚ÄúBut on the inside, getting to that place where you have momentum is hard.‚Äù

As they grew Lovevery, they found fundraising successfully was all about the timing. On an episode of How I Raised It, Jessica and Rod shared the lessons that came from raising $32 million for Lovevery over three funding rounds.

Even when we went out for tourism, a new model Airbnb or short-term rental appeared.

This was impossible to imagine before the prosperity of the Internet and software.

A biological marvel, the human itself known as homo sapiens. In the Latin language, it stands for a wise man. A wise man that survived about 200,000 years of evolution and extinction. There are many perspectives towards its survival and today I would like to share my perspective, slightly vague but different. There is a concept of what drives you that has become popular within the last decade. Certain presumptions about the driving force are based upon raw emotional aspects such as passion and rage. I find to myself that these aspects are reactions to our stubbornness to keep on going on but the negative aspect is that these reactions are short-lived and eventually man settles with peace. I would like to share a certain experience in a short period of my life that has produced results beyond my expectations. It is a small story of how I created my IoT Device converted into a product and made a company out of it.
