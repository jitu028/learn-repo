Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) is a protocol used to secure datagram-based communications. It's based on the stream-focused Transport Layer Security (TLS), providing a similar level of security. As a datagram protocol, DTLS doesn't guarantee the order of message delivery, or even that messages will be delivered at all. However, DTLS gains the benefits of datagram protocols, too; in particular, the lower overhead and reduced latency.

It’s been over a year since COVID-19 appeared, and it’s still painfully apparent that this crisis is far from over. In fact, it may even trigger the largest economic change since World War Two. According to Arthur D. Little, a management consultancy firm, COVID-19 has been the impetus for an economic shift from a resources-driven to technology-focused economic model, one where the principles of “green” and tech go hand-in-hand. In essence, it will be data, not natural resources, which plays the fundamental role in keeping the global economy running. One possible implication of this is a full-scale transition to a digital economy. Data will be the fuel which powers our lives – and emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart technologies will have to hit the ground running.

Trust On First Use (TOFU) is a security model in which a client needs to create a trust relationship with an unknown server. To do that, clients will look for identifiers (for example public keys) stored locally. If an identifier 
is found, the client can establish the connection. If no identifier is found, the client can prompt the user to determine if the client should trust the identifier.

Most businesses these days use RAID systems to gain improved performance and security. Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) systems are a configuration of multiple disk drives that can improve storage and computing capabilities. This system comprises multiple hard disks that are connected to a single logical unit to provide more functions. As one single operating system, RAID architecture (RAID level 0, 1, 5, 6, etc.) distributes data over all disks.

Staying safe on the internet has grown harder over the past few years as both technology and hackers have developed. Recently though, hackers are gaining an edge by not just manipulating the tech, but by manipulating the users themselves. In 2018, weak or stolen passwords were tied to over 80% of security breaches and in 2019, there were over 150,000 security incidents and nearly 4,000 confirmed data breaches. In 2020 alone, more than 15 billion stolen credentials were up for sale on the dark web. All this data points out the fact that our current way of protecting data is flawed, but making a new way to protect it while still maintaining security and convenience is a high mark to hit.

Businesses and personal users alike, cybersecurity is a growing necessity. With the increase of breaches, cybercrime, and more sophisticated hackers in this world, it is more important than ever to ensure that your data and network are secure and safe from criminals. If you are a business, then you likely have a dedicated IT team that helps ensure the safety of the data and network at your business, but it is important for you to understand what needs to be done so you can better direct your IT department. If you are a personal user, never believe that your data and online security is not valuable, as it most often is just as valuable as your physical possessions. Just as there are steps to prevent intestinal permeability, there are steps that can be taken to prevent someone from hacking your information.

We use passwords to access personal information and user accounts. With so many applications requiring passwords (e.g. online banking, shopping and social media just to name a few), it can be hard to track and at worst remember. Some applications require users to change their passwords every so often, and that can lead to users forgetting them or getting careless by writing down their password on a piece of paper. That piece of paper can later be misplaced which can lead to worse things. The problem with requiring frequent password changes and applying complexity to passwords is that it can become more complicated for users.

The ground-breaking anti-piracy deal signed by Russia-based content and Internet platforms in 2018 will not be written into local law any time soon. The agreement, which sees search engines voluntarily delete allegedly-infringing links, was supposed to be formalized in recent months but in the face of complexities and parliament being tied up with other things, will now be extended until 2021.

This morning several news articles celebrated the "return" of Popcorn Time after it apparently went offline a few years ago. This claim simply isn't true, 
neither is the assertion that the just released version of the app works as well as the previous one. In fact, Popcorn Time is facing a wave of complaints from users experiencing a wide range of problems that simply didn't exist before.

A man from the US became a hero last year when a video of him subduing a man who had headbutted someone in the face went viral. The video has been reposted numerous times since but is regularly taken down following 
bogus copyright complaints. However, the censorship efforts massively

Last week the Internet Archive responded to the coronavirus outbreak by offering a new service to "displaced learners". Combining scanned books from three libraries, the Archive offered unlimited borrowing of 1.4 million 
books, so that people can continue reading while in quarantine. What 
followed was a huge backlash from publishing and pro-copyright groups, 
with the Copyright Alliance decribing the actions of IA's operator as "particularly vile."

One of the hardest parts about choosing a VPN is finding one that won’t impact the speed of your online connection.

SIEM stands for "Security Information and Event Management". It is a set of tools and services that offer a holistic view of any organisation's information security. It works by combining two technologies: Security information Management(SIM), which collects data from the log files and runs an analysis on the security vulnerabilities and reports them, and Security Event Management(SEM) which monitors any system on a areal-time basis and also keeps the network admins notified about the threats. SIEM is used to identify threats and anomalies in the network, cyber attacks from gigs of data.

It’s been over a year since COVID-19 appeared, and it’s still painfully apparent that this crisis is far from over. In fact, it may even trigger the largest economic change since World War Two. According to Arthur D. Little, a management consultancy firm, COVID-19 has been the impetus for an economic shift from a resources-driven to technology-focused economic model, one where the principles of “green” and tech go hand-in-hand. In essence, it will be data, not natural resources, which plays the fundamental role in keeping the global economy running. One possible implication of this is a full-scale transition to a digital economy. Data will be the fuel which powers our lives – and emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart technologies will have to hit the ground running.

Lots of Internet users have most likely heard the saying that "data is the new currency." Of course, information has been important throughout the whole history of humankind, but the emergence of the digital world revealed just how powerful it could be. Millions of user-profiles circulate in ad networks to be used in future ad campaigns to enhance product placement.

And that's not necessarily bad. Seeing relevant advertisements saves time and helps in making the correct purchase decision. However, the problem arises when collected data is misused, as was revealed during the Cambridge Analytica scandal when illegally obtained user-data was used to influence political landscapes. Another problem is user consent. Sadly, a lot of data is gathered without user permission.

There's a massive problem in the privacy world. Websites, social media accounts, and other platforms are constantly popping up out of nowhere, telling you to buy The Greatest Service Ever in order to solve all your privacy woes, whatever that may be.

Even well known organizations such as Canon, Garmin, Twitter, Honda, and Travelex have fallen victims to malicious actors. A data breach can be a disaster for your company/project, destroy the trust of your customers, and spoil your company’s reputation.

For example, viruses have been well-known for decades. Every PC is currently protected with antivirus software--and in many cases, it’s incorporated right into your operating system. Other types of internet threats, such as botnets, are newer, more difficult to detect, and less known to web users.

When the first computers were made, the information needed to run them was on punch cards. The computing device would decode the patterns on the punch cards and translate it to an action. It wasn’t until 1956 that IBM came up with the first magnetic hard drive, and floppy discs didn’t enter the scene until the 1960s. Early computer storage was rudimentary, which is why there was no real viable threat of hackers in those early decades of computing. Once data storage became more sophisticated, hackers became a real threat. Subsequently, the need for cyber protection was born.

In recent months, individuals across the globe have shifted to a remote way of life, including working from home, virtual dating, drive-by birthday parties and now, even doctor’s appointments. The healthcare sector quickly implemented changes to provide a more remote experience to comply with social distancing regulations.

To decrease the number of face-to-face doctor’s appointments and adhere to social distancing limitations and regulations, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced they “will not impose penalties for noncompliance” with the regulatory requirements under the HIPAA Rules against covered health care providers in connection with the good faith provision of telehealth during the COVID-19 nationwide public health emergency.

Verifiable credentials, which provide a system for provable electronic facts and documentation through cryptography and public keys, can seem like an abstract concept. We’re so used to seeing our credentials printed out – the driver’s license, the passport, the insurance card – that sticking codified IDs on a thumb drive or online seems odd and unnecessary. And as anyone who has used a cryptocurrency wallet can attest, the early forms of such decentralized IDs are hardly user friendly.

Cyber security is a human issue before it is technological. This is why all companies — whatever their size — must work on bringing awareness of these issues to their employees. Today, companies are targeted, because hackers ultimately are looking to access their customers and suppliers. Cyber security is therefore no longer a niche activity and, above all, is no longer something that can be ignored or put aside.

You may be a Satoshi Nakamoto or an Albert Gonzalez, it is your choice. There is nothing wrong with the hacker knowledge. It is all about you. What You’ll Learn

It seems a week doesn’t go by without more news of another cryptocurrency hack, fault, failure, scam, or what have you. Just this week saw EOS have a hacker lift $7.7 million in EOS after a mistake by one of their validators. You will often hear about how these types of transactions get resolved later, but not a lot of information is provided about how that happened. Last week I saw the news that controversial Italian surveillance vendor Neutrino was acquired by Coinbase (which Coinbase has already come to regret) and when I read up on them, I realized that it was companies like Neutrino that are able to help repair those hacks, track down the terrorist funding, ransomware, the gun running, and drug sales and other nefarious activity that can take place on blockchain. This led me to research the companies in this space and the one that looked the most robust to me was CipherTrace and speaking with CEO and co-founder Dave Jevans to find out more about what they do and how they do it.

Artificial Intelligence, the term which first originated in the 1950s has now emerged as a prominent buzzword all over the world. More than 15% of companies are using AI and it is proving to be one of the most powerful and game-changing technology advancements of all time. From Siri to Sophia, the technology has people noticing it and wondering how this will impact their future.

Presently, Artificial Intelligence is seen everywhere. Major industries like healthcare, education, manufacturing, and banking are investing in AI for their digital transformation. Cybersecurity, being the major concern of the digital world, is still uncertain about the impact AI will have on it. With the fast-growing cyber attacks and attackers, cybercrime is growing to become a  massively profitable business which is one of the largest threats to every firm in the world. For this very reason, many companies are implementing Artificial Intelligence techniques which automatically detect threats and fight them without human involvement.

How AI Is Enhancing Cybersecurity
Artificial Intelligence is improving cybersecurity by automating complicated methods which detect attacks and react to security breaches. This leads to improvement in monitoring incidents leading to faster detection of threats and its consequent responses. These two aspects are quite essential as they minimize the damages caused. Various Machine Learning algorithms are adapted for this process depending on the data obtained. In the field of cybersecurity, these algorithms can identify exceptions and predict threats with greater speed and accuracy.

We use passwords to access personal information and user accounts. With so many applications requiring passwords (e.g. online banking, shopping and social media just to name a few), it can be hard to track and at worst remember. Some applications require users to change their passwords every so often, and that can lead to users forgetting them or getting careless by writing down their password on a piece of paper. That piece of paper can later be misplaced which can lead to worse things. The problem with requiring frequent password changes and applying complexity to passwords is that it can become more complicated for users.

You may be a Satoshi Nakamoto or an Albert Gonzalez, it is your choice. There is nothing wrong with the hacker knowledge. It is all about you. What You’ll Learn

But to ensure compliance and retain privacy, organizations need to transfer the data in an encrypted format, which does ensure the confidentiality of the data. However, once the data reaches the cloud, the CSP has to decrypt the data to perform operation or computation.

Free WiFi has become so ubiquitous that you’d be hard-pressed to find a Starbucks that does not offer it. People rarely give it a second thought when browsing in a cafe or even using public Wi Fi for business to stay productive. Unfortunately, such carelessness may come at a price, as public hotspots make it quite easy to hack your device and steal sensitive data. Let’s look at what risks free WiFi poses and what you can do about it.

As a tech enthusiast and programmer, I love trying new platforms that attempt to reinvent the way we interact with computers, the internet, and each other. One of the most outdated yet crucial tools we interact with every day — the search engine — is due for disruption. Many companies recognize this and have tried to redesign and reinvent the search process. To stay at the forefront of this search engine revolution and take control over my search results, I experimented with several smaller search engines (most still in beta). One of the most innovative and curated alternative search engines is You.com. In my opinion, their recent release of YouCode has the potential to reshape how programmers interact with the internet, expedite problem solving, and enhance software design. Today I will be reviewing this novel search engine and discussing how I use it to improve my coding.

The Senate Intelligence Committee recently released a report detailing Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Russian interference is nothing new – discourse since 2016 has focused on Russia’s (technically legal) social engineering and manipulation of social networks. The report, however, confirms Russia’s definitively illegal interference with electronic voting systems, and “the US was unprepared at all levels of government for a concerted attack from a determined foreign adversary on our election infrastructure,” said Committee Chairman Richard Burr in an accompanying statement.

Given American technological capabilities, how was this interference possible?

Voting is still in the dark ages

Voting lies at the heart of democracy, yet it has failed to make the same technological advancements that we’ve come to expect in other facets of our lives. Almost five decades into the “digital revolution,” we still consider paper ballots the “secure” standard for choosing leadership.

Why don’t we vote electronically?

Implicit in our trust of paper-based systems is a distrust of technology. Although technology has the potential to revolutionize the democratic process, the digital voting systems currently in place are often far from secure.

Today’s electronic ballot boxes, when implemented incorrectly, pose astonishing risks: For example, the US’ electronic ballot systems (called DRE, which stands for “direct electronic recording”) have notoriously relied on Windows XP, a software released in 2001. In 2014, security expert Carsten Schuermann hacked into a DRE machine over a Wi-Fi network in mere minutes by exploiting Windows XP’s old security protocols.

Smart devices are great. They help you search the internet with only your voice, allow you to order essentials without using your phone or computer, and let you see who's at the door. But they also do one other thing. They are listening, all the time. While Alexa is best known for this morally dubious listening, it's not just them. Google has just been shown to do the same. It seems like every smart device is listening in to your conversations. Let's talk about potential concerns and why these companies are doing this.

Last year, blockchain technology proved its mettle against the backdrop of a failing financial order and a thinly stretched health sector. The growing allure of this technology stems from its innovative approach to recurring issues in a broad range of industries. Recently, Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, reiterated his commitment towards utilizing blockchain technology to engineer a privacy-focused and fully decentralized social media platform. In the financial scene, we have witnessed the fusing of digital assets and legacy systems, which gave birth to the central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and other blockchain-enabled banking operations. As such, there is no doubt that blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are here to stay.

We’ve all heard about credit card skimming. This is the method by which skimmers attach devices to ATMs and gas pumps that capture your credit card number, and it’s often associated with a camera to catch you putting in your PIN. In 2018, credit and debit card fraud resulted in $28 billion in losses. This has prompted repeated calls for people to be on the lookout for things that are suspicious, cover their hands when they input their PIN numbers, and to only use “reputable” ATMs and gas pumps. Unfortunately the fraudsters are always one step ahead, and they are always coming up with new and creative ways to commit fraud.

We live in the age of constant surveillance, unlike the one described by George Orwell in his seminal book 1984, but the one which might have bought willingly. We regularly surrender information in exchange for free services and convenience. Often, we skim over the fine print of user agreements, and the act of disseminating private information becomes a voluntary task that absolves the media giants from any legal burden [3]. Ian Bogost of The Atlantic calls this “the age of privacy nihilism” and says that the changes in escaping surveillance capitalism are bleak [4].

Facebook, Google, Amazon. Everybody seems to be out to get your data. No wonder, monetising data is a massive business that propelled centralised data controllers to the market cap stratosphere. But what do you get for giving away your data? A “free” service, if you are lucky, and a breakdown of democracy if you are fresh out of luck. Consequently, a number of people are pushing the idea that users should control their data using self-sovereign identity (SSI) management systems (like sovrin) and interoperable data pods (such as inrupt). As it turns out, though, this approach has a number of fundamental issues as well.

Businesses and personal users alike, cybersecurity is a growing necessity.

If you are a business, then you likely have a dedicated IT team that helps ensure the safety of the data and network at your business, but it is important for you to understand what needs to be done so you can better direct your IT department. If you are a personal user, never believe that your data and online security is not valuable, as it most often is just as valuable as your physical possessions. Just as there are steps to prevent intestinal permeability, there are steps that can be taken to prevent someone from hacking your information.

If you care about your security on the web, you probably use a Two-Factor authentication (2FA) method to protect your accounts. There are various 2FA methods available out there, a combination of password + fingerprint, for example, is one of them. However, since not so many people have a fingerprint reader available all the time, one of the most popular 2FA methods today is to use an authenticator app on your cellphone to generate a temporary password that expires within a minute or even less. But, how does this temporary password, called Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) works, and how can I implement that on my own service?

Hashing algorithms are one-way functions. They take any string and turn it into a fixed-length “fingerprint” that is unable to be reversed. This means that if your data in your database is compromised, the hacker cannot get the user’s passwords if they were hashed well because at no point were they ever stored on the drive without being in their hashed form.

Fernando Corbato pioneered the first computer password in 1960, being used as a personal point of entry on MIT's Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). Just 2 years later, the CTSS was hacked and has been inspiring hackers ever since. There have been immense technological advancements since 1962 - how is it that today's hackers can get through 2-step authentication, biometrics, and security questions? Cryptographers predict a future that moves beyond passwords, but the issue seems to lie between cybersecurity and human nature.

A 2019 research conducted by HYPR showed that 78% of people forgot their passwords and required a reset within the last 90 days. Passwords aren’t just difficult to manage, they are inconvenient, insecure, and expensive because passwords are just too easy to guess, hack or intercept and what’s more, the legacy of password reuse is leading to constant attack and account vulnerabilities.

Everyone knows it’s a good idea to use strong, unique passwords, and as employees around the world have been forced to work remotely, logging in from multiple devices and multiple locations, the need for strong password security has only grown. But last year’s Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) revealed that weak or compromised credentials still cause 80% of hacking-related breaches. Throughout the current pandemic, attackers have been scouring remote workforce applications to gather and sell user credentials on the dark web, even targeting healthcare organizations such as the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization.

Facebook, Google, Amazon. Everybody seems to be out to get your data. No wonder, monetising data is a massive business that propelled centralised data controllers to the market cap stratosphere. But what do you get for giving away your data? A “free” service, if you are lucky, and a breakdown of democracy if you are fresh out of luck. Consequently, a number of people are pushing the idea that users should control their data using self-sovereign identity (SSI) management systems (like sovrin) and interoperable data pods (such as inrupt). As it turns out, though, this approach has a number of fundamental issues as well.

There have been countless anti-piracy strategies deployed over the years and pirates have deployed their own in response. In the end, the parties "at war" aren't so different and may even benefit from the same techniques. The most fundamental ones aren't new either, having been around for at least 2,500 years.

Adult movie company AMA Multimedia has obtained a DMCA subpoena from a Washington court to help it track down individuals who uploaded content to various 'tube' sites. The subpoena orders Cloudflare to hand over the identities of uploaders and potentially site operators too but given the way the content seems to be delivered, it remains a question whether the former will be possible.

Last week the Internet Archive responded to the coronavirus outbreak by offering a new service to "displaced learners". Combining scanned books from three libraries, the Archive offered unlimited borrowing of 1.4 million 
books, so that people can continue reading while in quarantine. What 
followed was a huge backlash from publishing and pro-copyright groups, 
with the Copyright Alliance decribing the actions of IA's operator as "particularly vile."

Smart devices are great. They help you search the internet with only your voice, allow you to order essentials without using your phone or computer, and let you see who's at the door. But they also do one other thing. They are listening, all the time. While Alexa is best known for this morally dubious listening, it's not just them. Google has just been shown to do the same. It seems like every smart device is listening in to your conversations. Let's talk about potential concerns and why these companies are doing this.

Stocktwits as a tool really excited me in the beginning, but I was awakened to a reality of things that are quite toxic. What inspired me, is that you seem to have had founders with an innovative vision in terms of creating a community for stocks and stock tickers. However, this community may have become a safe haven for trolling, internet harassment, defamation, stock dumping, privacy concerns, and much more. This isn't to personally come after the founders or anything like this, as I warrant a healthy discussion on how to improve big tech. We do need to look at the problems though.

Instead of your local delivery man, a drone may drop a package right on your doorstep. The true power of drones goes well beyond that, though. They provide businesses with data that’s difficult to collect otherwise. In addition to taking aerial photos and videos, drones can collect information about everything from the health of crops to thermal leaks in buildings.

It’s been over a year since COVID-19 appeared, and it’s still painfully apparent that this crisis is far from over. In fact, it may even trigger the largest economic change since World War Two. According to Arthur D. Little, a management consultancy firm, COVID-19 has been the impetus for an economic shift from a resources-driven to technology-focused economic model, one where the principles of “green” and tech go hand-in-hand. In essence, it will be data, not natural resources, which plays the fundamental role in keeping the global economy running. One possible implication of this is a full-scale transition to a digital economy. Data will be the fuel which powers our lives – and emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart technologies will have to hit the ground running.

A lateral thought on the same might suggest that data in modern times is your life expressed in cryptic format owing to the considerable amount of time that we are now devoting towards shifting our lives from a manual to a digital gear.

Stocktwits as a tool really excited me in the beginning, but I was awakened to a reality of things that are quite toxic. What inspired me, is that you seem to have had founders with an innovative vision in terms of creating a community for stocks and stock tickers. However, this community may have become a safe haven for trolling, internet harassment, defamation, stock dumping, privacy concerns, and much more. This isn't to personally come after the founders or anything like this, as I warrant a healthy discussion on how to improve big tech. We do need to look at the problems though.

Digital Transformation in every field of our lives has led to the increased collection of our personal data on every device we touch from laptops to mobile phones, to tablets, leaving a digital trail.

Facebook, Google, Amazon. Everybody seems to be out to get your data. No wonder, monetising data is a massive business that propelled centralised data controllers to the market cap stratosphere. But what do you get for giving away your data? A “free” service, if you are lucky, and a breakdown of democracy if you are fresh out of luck. Consequently, a number of people are pushing the idea that users should control their data using self-sovereign identity (SSI) management systems (like sovrin) and interoperable data pods (such as inrupt). As it turns out, though, this approach has a number of fundamental issues as well.

Katy Perry's writers lost a $2.8m lawsuit against Christian rapper Flame last year over the use of a handful of notes. Musician Adam Neely published a hit video on YouTube slamming the lawsuit but in a bizarre twist, Perry's publisher Warner Chappell has now filed an infringement complaint against Neely. Not only have they claimed all of the advertising revenue from his video, they've turned the entire matter into an unbelievable trainwreck.

Last week the Internet Archive responded to the coronavirus outbreak by offering a new service to "displaced learners". Combining scanned books from three libraries, the Archive offered unlimited borrowing of 1.4 million

followed was a huge backlash from publishing and pro-copyright groups, 
with the Copyright Alliance decribing the actions of IA's operator as "particularly vile."

More than two thirds of the U.S. population is now stuck at home as more states are creating new restrictions to try to slow the spread of COVID-19. The internet is now being used more than ever as millions are turning to it as an alternative source of social connection, work, and entertainment. In Seattle, one of the cities in the U.S. that was hardest hit by the virus, internet traffic quickly began to rise - from January to March it has risen by an astounding 30%. Other U.S. ISPs are noticing huge spikes in WiFi calling, online gaming, and VPN usage across the country. With a huge number of increased active users, governments and companies alike are making moves to help Americans stay online. One of these steps is the FCC’s Keep Americans Connected pledge that over 70 telecom companies have signed stating that these companies will waive late fees and retain service even with lack of payment. Other companies are making public WiFi networks for students and remote workers. Comcast is setting up public hotspots for free use, Comcast and Spectrum are both offering 2 free months of access to low-income families, and AT&T is suspending broadband usage caps.

Trying to find the best VPN can be a daunting task, especially when there are so many to choose from. While free VPNs might seem like an easy way to dive into better security and bypass content locks, many of them are also likely to steal information and leave users in worse spots than they already were. Not every free VPN does this, but those wishing to truly be secure online will be much more comfortable with a paid service. Luckily, some of the best VPN services come with a free trial, and users would do very well to take advantage of them.

In 2019, more than 627 million online records were comprised due to hacking and other types of cyber attacks. This is a pretty staggering number to anyone who has made an online transaction, but the amount of attacks that were stopped is much higher, so it’s worth some optimism. As COVID-19 has pushed many companies into the remote work world, online transactions and records are growing exponentially, and most experts believe that remote work will continue to be very popular even after stay-at-home orders get lifted and life goes back to some form of normal.

As we adjust to life during a pandemic, two things have become clear: First, the internet is essential; second,  the internet is full of dangers. Each of these dangers is different: They vary in the sort of attack they strike with, our familiarity with them, and the tools we can use to avert them. For example, viruses have been well-known for decades. Every PC is currently protected with antivirus software--and in many cases, it’s incorporated right into your operating system. Other types of internet threats, such as botnets, are newer, more difficult to detect, and less known to web users.

Organizations nowadays are storing and performing computation of the data on the cloud instead of handling themselves. Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) provide these services at an affordable cost and low maintenance. But to ensure compliance and retain privacy, organizations need to transfer the data in an encrypted format, which does ensure the confidentiality of the data. However, once the data reaches the cloud, the CSP has to decrypt the data to perform operation or computation.

Imagine, you are messaging your business partner about a super secret idea, it is worth $ 1m, will you trust the messaging application not to read your super secret conversation? No, right. No one will, still people across the world use whatsapp for such sensitive messaging (although I prefer telegram for my secret conversations). Well, turns out, it is because most messaging apps(including whatsapp) use a technique called End to End Encryption, which doesn’t allow these messaging services or their employees to read your conversations with your contacts. But how does this works, well, that is what we will try to understand here.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/1yuf73tpt.jpg)
We use passwords to access personal information and user accounts. With so many applications requiring passwords (e.g. online banking, shopping and social media just to name a few), it can be hard to track and at worst remember. Some applications require users to change their passwords every so often, and that can lead to users forgetting them or getting careless by writing down their password on a piece of paper. That piece of paper can later be misplaced which can lead to worse things. The problem with requiring frequent password changes and applying complexity to passwords is that it can become more complicated for users.

We’ve all heard about credit card skimming. This is the method by which skimmers attach devices to ATMs and gas pumps that capture your credit card number, and it’s often associated with a camera to catch you putting in your PIN. In 2018, credit and debit card fraud resulted in $28 billion in losses. This has prompted repeated calls for people to be on the lookout for things that are suspicious, cover their hands when they input their PIN numbers, and to only use “reputable” ATMs and gas pumps. Unfortunately the fraudsters are always one step ahead, and they are always coming up with new and creative ways to commit fraud.

Security is a ‘state of mind’ and not an end state. It has been a popular philosophical thought, but what it eludes is the fact of investment towards security. IoT has exploded with the onset of new smart tech gadgets. Though businesses today exercise security and safety measures within their organizations, it isn’t easy to keep upgrading an organization’s infrastructure to encompass these technology updates. Reverse engineering systems have always remained the passcode for unlocking backdoors to capitalize on security vulnerabilities. The best example of such a scenario is the 2016 MIRAI botnet attack. The attack caused massive DDoS attacks on large enterprises on Atlanta’s city administration and the ATL airport. IoT still lacks immunity against ransomware attacks and many new age cyberattacks.

If you want to access data in a distributed environment such as in a microservice architecture, then data services are the way to go. The idea is to create a data abstraction layer (DAL) that the rest of the system’s applications and services can share. Thus, a data service gives you a generalized interface to the data you’re exposing and provides access to it in a standard manner. This would be in a well-understood protocol and a known data format. For example, a popular approach is to use JSON via HTTP/S.

We are familiar with flash loan attacks that use uncollateralised loans across a multitude of protocols to manipulate certain markets and pump-and-dump certain assets. We also know about reentrancy attacks that exploit the logic of execution of functions inside a smart contract. However, the Badger DAO exploit was both more and less ingenious at once.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/1yuf73tpt.jpg)
We use passwords to access personal information and user accounts. With so many applications requiring passwords (e.g. online banking, shopping and social media just to name a few), it can be hard to track and at worst remember. Some applications require users to change their passwords every so often, and that can lead to users forgetting them or getting careless by writing down their password on a piece of paper. That piece of paper can later be misplaced which can lead to worse things. The problem with requiring frequent password changes and applying complexity to passwords is that it can become more complicated for users.

The UK's Intellectual Property Office has published the latest edition of its

Interestingly, the report also highlights a significant decrease in hardcore pirates.

In what appears to be a monumental screw-up somewhere in the game's supply chain, the Denuvo anti-tamper technology deployed on Doom Eternal may have already been compromised. Early purchasers of the game discovered a folder in the game's directory containing an .exe file that can be used to replace the original one protected by Denuvo.

A draft law in Sweden envisions much tougher penalties for serious copyright infringement. Under current rules, sentences carry fines and/or prison terms up to a maximum of two years. Under the new proposals, serious copyright-related crimes would be treated more harshly, with prison sentences starting at six months and going all the way to a maximum of six years.

Movie and TV show information portal AlloCiné has reportedly sent a wave of DMCA notices to Google to have allegedly-infringing content taken down. Unfortunately, however, the complaints are littered with clearly erroneous URLs that target everything from Netflix and Amazon listings to news reports from sites like Wired, plus content on rival movie portals such as JustWatch and Rotten Tomatoes.

The ground-breaking anti-piracy deal signed by Russia-based content and Internet platforms in 2018 will not be written into local law any time soon. The agreement, which sees search engines voluntarily delete allegedly-infringing links, was supposed to be formalized in recent months but in the face of complexities and parliament being tied up with other things, will now be extended until 2021.

Major Japanese publisher Takeshobo has sued Cloudflare in a Tokyo court for alleged copyright infringement. The publisher says it was forced into 
the action after requests to remove content being offered by a Cloudflare customer were ignored. Takeshobo is taking care not to mention the name of the 'pirate' site in question but TorrentFreak has uncovered a DMCA subpoena from 2019 which may shine some light on proceedings.

The order was requested by Bell, Rogers, and Groupe TVA, who recently asked the court to amend the order to ban additional domains that provide access the pirate IPTV service GoldTV.

In many blockchain platforms such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, data confidentiality is a kind of excluded item in their blockchain framework. In these distributed blockchain platform transactions are executed in every participant node in the network. So, every transaction in the network can be visible to all the peers. The ledger update process through all the endorsed peers and has to reach an agreement among all before it committed successfully to the ledger. So, in this scenario creating a private record and comprises within a certain group of participants in the network is a complete “No”.

Customers and Cloud Service Provider (CSP) share the responsibility of security and compliance. Thus, the organization would have the freedom to have architect their security and compliance needs, according to the services they utilize from the CSP and the services they intend to achieve. CSP has the responsibility to provide services securely and to provide physical security of the cloud. If, however, a customer opts for Software-as-a-service, then the CSP provides standard compliance. Still, the organization has to check if it meets its regulations and compliance levels to strive to achieve. All Cloud services (such ad different forms of databases) are not created equal. Policies and procedures should be agreed upon between CSP and client for all security requirements and operations responsibility.

On July 8, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) announced the highest GDPR fine ever of £183 million over last year’s data breach at British Airways. The UK’s data watchdog elected to fine the airline as its “poor security arrangements” led to the breach of credit card information, names, addresses, travel booking details, and logins of around 500,000 customers.  In recent years, consumers have become wearily accustomed to data breaches of this magnitude.

We live in the age of constant surveillance, unlike the one described by George Orwell in his seminal book 1984, but the one which might have bought willingly. We regularly surrender information in exchange for free services and convenience. Often, we skim over the fine print of user agreements, and the act of disseminating private information becomes a voluntary task that absolves the media giants from any legal burden [3]. Ian Bogost of The Atlantic calls this “the age of privacy nihilism” and says that the changes in escaping surveillance capitalism are bleak [4].

It’s been over a year since the GDPR came into effect, and at least five since it was first debated seriously. For much of that time it was discussed as a global game-changer, yet the predicted earth-shaking effects of its implementation — billion-dollar fines, the end of data exploitation by rogue firms, high-profile court cases — have largely yet to materialize. Instead, the landscape of the internet has changed in more subtle and complex ways which could not have been predicted by pundits, and it’s affecting businesses of every size.

As the demand for high-quality software engineers increases, employers hiring remotely will find themselves ahead of the competition. This is because hiring remotely allows employers and startup founders to expand their talent pool and hire the best candidate no matter where they live. It also leads to reducing costs and improving employees’ productivity and retention.

You’ve probably heard plenty about 5G in the past few years, as this promising new generation of wireless technology is what’s enabling the continued spread of the internet of things and a host of other digital innovations. Virtually all tech experts agree that 5G technology is a good thing, given that it will lead to faster connectivity and more secure networks.

Hashing algorithms are one-way functions. They take any string and turn it into a fixed-length “fingerprint” that is unable to be reversed. This means that if your data in your database is compromised, the hacker cannot get the user’s passwords if they were hashed well because at no point were they ever stored on the drive without being in their hashed form.

Web security is a topic that is often overlooked by frontend developers. When we assess the quality of the website, we often look at metrics like performance, SEO-friendliness, and accessibility, while the website’s capacity to withstand malicious attacks often falls under the radar. And even though the sensitive user data is stored server-side and significant measures must be taken by backend developers to protect the servers, in the end, the responsibility for securing that data is shared between both backend and frontend. While sensitive data may be safely locked in a backend warehouse, the frontend holds the keys to its front door, and stealing them is often the easiest way to gain access.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/b81t33o9.png)
Standard authentication methods such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and one-time passwords work as filters at the entrance of the protected perimeter. But what if someone managed to trick these filters or changed the user after their successful login? Cyber attackers may steal credentials of legitimate users and even one-time passcodes using malware and different phishing techniques. In the companies without special employee monitoring software, employees often nonchalantly share their logins and passwords with colleagues. Finally, there’s always a risk of someone getting a hold of a corporate device such as a laptop or smartphone with full access to the corporate network, critical resources, and applications.

In 2020, there will be just one thing considered to be more important than product quality for consumers: data privacy. By this I refer not to user-controlled measures to add extra security for internet users, from the most classic one-time password, or two-factor authentication, to the most secure multi-factor authentication methods:  but data privacy measures implemented by companies to ensure that peoples’ personal data is protected - no matter what.

Several years ago, a casual Internet user asked about VPNs would most likely scratch his or her head in uncertainty. Sure, VPNs have been around since Microsoft developed the PPTP protocol in 1996 and granted employees a somewhat safe remote access to confidential business resources on distant databases. But in 1996 there was a total amount of 36 million Internet users, and cybersecurity was an oblique idea for most of them.

Golang recently turned 10 and the success this language has created over the last 10 years is overwhelming. Today, many of the most popular DevOps tools are now written in Go. This proves that Go is a language that has a great future in the DevOps industry. It is meant for cloud network infrastructure practitioners - this was one of the primary goals of the Go creators. As a result, Every major cloud provider today has turned to Go for their core cloud infrastructure, to name some - Docker, Kubernetes, Istio, Etcd, Prometheus, and Terraform.

Make no mistake, the knowledge of hacking is different from a hacker. A hacker is a person, not the skill. And the use of any knowledge is a personal choice and that choice isn’t universal. The same way some politicians are corrupt, some hackers are corrupt. The same way some politicians are good, some hackers are good also. You may be a Satoshi Nakamoto or an Albert Gonzalez, it is your choice. There is nothing wrong with the hacker knowledge. It is all about you. What You’ll Learn

DevSecOps is the new buzz and definitely a potential candidate to scare people in the ever-changing software industry. When I heard the term for the first time, my inner voice said it out loud, "When just this Happened, and why SEC is sandwich between them ?". Later on, to look cool, I started adding DevSecOps on my profile, but the dire consequence was a complete disappointment. DevSecOps isn't just restricted to understand security by heart & fit it with DevOps. A good analogy would be not to imagine your ex with someone, especially with your girlfriend/wife. It is all about "Shift left on Security" i.e. to introduce security as early as possible in the SDLC. Though I am not going to bore you with the definitions and concepts as I am a practical person. Thus, my objective here is to demonstrate how DevSecOps works in reality. The following series split into two parts (refer below) with very simple and clear instructions to provision a CI/CD pipeline adhering to DevSecOps principles in AWS. Everything covered from scratch you won't face any difficulty understanding. In case of any clarification, drop me a note on LinkedIn.

Staying safe on the internet has grown harder over the past few years as both technology and hackers have developed. Recently though, hackers are gaining an edge by not just manipulating the tech, but by manipulating the users themselves. In 2018, weak or stolen passwords were tied to over 80% of security breaches and in 2019, there were over 150,000 security incidents and nearly 4,000 confirmed data breaches. In 2020 alone, more than 15 billion stolen credentials were up for sale on the dark web. All this data points out the fact that our current way of protecting data is flawed, but making a new way to protect it while still maintaining security and convenience is a high mark to hit.

As we adjust to life during a pandemic, two things have become clear: First, the internet is essential; second,  the internet is full of dangers. Each of these dangers is different: They vary in the sort of attack they strike with, our familiarity with them, and the tools we can use to avert them. For example, viruses have been well-known for decades. Every PC is currently protected with antivirus software--and in many cases, it’s incorporated right into your operating system. Other types of internet threats, such as botnets, are newer, more difficult to detect, and less known to web users.
